<p>The bee was revived as a symbol of government by Emperor Napoleon I of France. Both the Hindu <em>Atharva Veda</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee#cite_note-75"> </a> and the ancient Greeks associated lips anointed with honey with the gift of eloquence and even of prescience. The priestess at Delphi was the "Delphic Bee". The <em>Quran</em> has a chapter titled "The Bee". A community of honey bees has often been employed by political theorists as a model of human society, from Aristotle and Plato to Virgil and Seneca; in Erasmus and Shakespeare; in Marx and Tolstoy. Honey bees, signifying immortality and resurrection, were royal emblems of the Merovingians. The bee also is the heraldic emblem of the Barberini. The state of Utah is called the "Beehive State", the state emblem is the beehive, the state insect is the honey bee, and a beehive and the word "industry" appear on both the state flag and seal.</p>
